# Icon-Map
Simple library for displaying an image within an image. Used in the 6th Gen MoonBuggy GUI from my other repositories. It started as a way to show visual location data from a server not connected to the internet. It received Latitude and Longitude input from a GPS device and sent it over a closed network.
