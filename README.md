Simple library for displaying an image within an image. Used in the 6th Gen MoonBuggy GUI from my other repositories. It started as a way to show visual location data from a server not connected to the internet. It received Latitude and Longitude input from a GPS device and sent it over a closed network.


For now I'm just making the library more general to use. This way I can use it for the following years of the competition.

## Install

```
$ npm install @jaortiz117/icon-maps
```

## Usage

```js
//TODO
